# Moea_ACAs
Weight Vectors Definition for MOEA/D-based Algorithms using Augmented Covering Arrays for Many-Objective Optimization

Instructions:
1. You have to create a Java project in Eclipse Java Neon
2. Include source code for MOEA/D-DE-ACA (directory MOEAD_DE_ACA of this repository)
3. Download MOEA Framework 2.12 and include it in the project (Configure Build Path)
4. Configure the path to the ACA files (line 284 of the algorithm/StandardAlgorithms class)
5. Run the test. Look for different packages, namely: experiments.V9T2, experiments.V17T2 and experiments.V9T3.
